
### Welcome!
This is a marvelous place where snowy days, rainy afternoons and sunny mornings are spent crafting and producing new algorithms for signal processing.

I am an engineer and researcher in the fields of Digital Signal Processing (DSP), Passive Acoustic Monitoring and Sound Modeling. My interests range from voice conversion and speech analysis to developing algorithms for acoustic ecology and ecological informatics. I am also involved and have several projects in machine learning for sound analysis. As of the moment, I am writing my dissertation in the field of parametric sound modelling. 


### Support or Contact
Interested in having a conversation about a particular topic or project? Questions about image or audio processing? Don't hesitate to [contact me](mailto:carlosa@deobaldia.com), I will be glad to help! Also, if you are interested in current research in DSP check out my [page in my institute's Website](https://www.hsu-hh.de/ant/obaldia). Have a blast!
